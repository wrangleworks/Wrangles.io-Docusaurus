## Accordion

Apply a series of wrangles to the individual elements of one or more lists.

### Examples

#### Apply Convert Case to List Elements

This example applies `convert.case` to each string in a list, where the wrangle would not normally operate on the list as a whole.

##### Recipe

```yaml
wrangles:
  - accordion:
      input: list_column
      output: modified_lists
      wrangles:
        - convert.case:
            input: list_column
            output: modified_lists
            case: upper
```

<div className="ww-sample-grid">

<div className="ww-sample-panel">

##### Input Sample

| list_column |
| --- |
| ["a", "b", "c"] |
| ["e", "f", "g"] |

</div>

<div className="ww-sample-panel">

##### Output Sample

| list_column | modified_lists |
| --- | --- |
| ["a", "b", "c"] | ["A", "B", "C"] |
| ["e", "f", "g"] | ["E", "F", "G"] |

</div>

</div>
