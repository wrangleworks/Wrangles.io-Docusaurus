## Batch

Execute a series of wrangles in batches. Batches can run in parallel with `threads` and can provide fallback output when an error occurs.

### Examples

#### Batch an Extract AI Wrangle

This example processes product descriptions in batches of two rows.

##### Recipe

```yaml
wrangles:
  - batch:
