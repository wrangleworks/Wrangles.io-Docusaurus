## Concurrent

Run multiple wrangles concurrently instead of sequentially. Concurrent wrangles must declare output columns, may finish in any order, and should not update overlapping columns.

See the [Concurrent connector](/python/connectors/concurrent) for the connector equivalent.

### Examples

#### Run Extraction Wrangles Concurrently

##### Recipe

```yaml
wrangles:
  - concurrent:
      wrangles:
        - extract.codes:
            input: Products
            output: Part Codes
        - extract.attributes:
            input: Products
            output: Attributes
```

<div className="ww-sample-grid">

<div className="ww-sample-panel">

##### Input Sample

| Products |
| --- |
| SKF ball brg 2" od 6202 |
| brg seal 1" id 5493 |
| 3lb hammer 87102 |

</div>

<div className="ww-sample-panel">

##### Output Sample

| Products | Part Codes | Attributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SKF ball brg 2" od 6202 | 6202 | `{"length":["2in"]}` |
| brg seal 1" id 5493 | 5493 | `{"length":["1in"]}` |
| 3lb hammer 87102 | 87102 | `{"weight":["3lb"]}` |

</div>

</div>
