### Examples

#### Assigning Letter Grades

##### Recipe

```yaml
wrangles:
  - compute.case_when:
      output: Letter Grade
      cases:
        - condition: Grade > 89
          value: 'A'
        - condition: 90 > Grade > 79
          value: 'B'
        - condition: 80 > Grade > 69
          value: 'C'
        - condition: 70 > Grade
          value: 'F'
```

##### Input Sample

| Student | Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Billy | 62 |
| Sarah | 91 |
| Timmy | 88 |
| Tammy | 74 |

##### Output Sample

| Student | Grade | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billy | 62 | F |
| Sarah | 91 | A |
| Timmy | 88 | B |
| Tammy | 74 | C |

#### Assigning Letter Grades with Attendance

Conditions can be combined so multiple criteria must be met before assigning a value.

##### Recipe

```yaml
wrangles:
  - compute.case_when:
      output: Letter Grade
      cases:
        - condition: (Grade > .89) & (Attendance == 'Good')
          value: 'A'
        - condition: (.90 > Grade > .79) & (Attendance == 'Good')
          value: 'B'
        - condition: (.80 > Grade > .69) & (Attendance == 'Good')
          value: 'C'
        - condition: (.70 > Grade) or (Attendance == 'Poor')
          value: 'F'
```

##### Input Sample

| Student | Grade | Attendance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billy | 62 | Poor |
| Sarah | 91 | Poor |
| Timmy | 88 | Good |
| Tammy | 74 | Good |

##### Output Sample

| Student | Grade | Attendance | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Billy | 62 | Poor | F |
| Sarah | 91 | Poor | F |
| Timmy | 88 | Good | B |
| Tammy | 74 | Good | C |
