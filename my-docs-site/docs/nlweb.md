# What is NLWeb?

NLWeb (Natural Language Web) is an open-source project that enables websites to offer natural language interfaces, allowing users to interact with web content using conversational queries instead of traditional navigation menus or search boxes. It brings AI-powered conversational experiences directly to websites, making them more intuitive and accessible.

## Key Features

### Conversational Interface
NLWeb transforms static websites into interactive, AI-powered applications where users can ask questions in everyday language:
- "Find me data transformation examples"
- "How do I standardize text data?"
- "Show me extract functions for dates"

### Leverages Existing Web Data
NLWeb works with structured data formats that many websites already use:
- Schema.org markup
- RSS feeds
- Sitemaps
- JSON-LD

This means no need to rebuild your content from scratch.

### Open Source & Flexible
- **Technology-Agnostic**: Works with various Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, and Gemini
- **Vector Database Support**: Integrates with Qdrant, Milvus, Azure AI Search, and others for semantic search
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Every NLWeb instance acts as an MCP server, allowing AI agents and applications to programmatically interact with the site

### Simple Integration
Websites can add NLWeb with just a few lines of code, deploying a chat interface that connects to structured data and LLM tools.

## Why NLWeb for Wrangles?

### Enhanced Data Discovery
NLWeb makes it easier to discover the right Wrangles for your data transformation needs through natural language queries:
- "How can I extract addresses from text?"
- "What's the best way to classify product descriptions?"
- "Show me examples of standardizing phone numbers"

### Improved Documentation Access
Instead of manually navigating through documentation, users can ask specific questions and get contextual answers based on the entire Wrangles knowledge base.

### AI-Readable Content
NLWeb positions the Wrangles documentation to be accessible not just to human users, but also to AI agents that can help automate data wrangling workflows.

## Use Cases

### For Data Engineers
- Quickly find the right transformation function for specific data patterns
- Discover best practices for complex data wrangling scenarios
- Get code examples tailored to your specific use case

### For Business Analysts
- Ask questions about data cleaning capabilities without technical jargon
- Find step-by-step guides for common data quality issues
- Understand which Wrangles to use for different data types

### For Developers
- Explore API documentation conversationally
- Find integration examples for specific systems
- Get help troubleshooting data transformation pipelines

## Getting Started

NLWeb integration allows you to interact with Wrangles documentation naturally. Simply type your question or request, and the AI-powered interface will help you find relevant information, examples, and guidance.

### Example Queries
- "How do I extract weights from product descriptions?"
- "What connectors are available for reading data?"
- "Show me recipe examples for data standardization"
- "How can I classify items into categories?"

## Benefits

1. **Faster Information Retrieval**: Get answers immediately without browsing multiple pages
2. **Context-Aware Responses**: Receive information tailored to your specific question
3. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Find what you need using natural language, not technical terms
4. **Better Discoverability**: Uncover features and capabilities you might not have known existed
5. **AI-First Experience**: Future-proof documentation that works for both humans and AI agents
