# What are Wrangles?
Wrangles are a set of modular transformations for data cleaning and enrichment. Wrangles allow you to change both the structure (how the data is formatted and arranged) as well as the semantics (the values, terms and meaning).

Each Wrangle is optimized for a particular job, many of which are backed by sophisticated AI models. With Wrangles, you can:


- **Extract** information from a set of messy descriptions.

- Predict which category items belong to using **Classify**.

- **Standardize** text data to a desired format.

- Transform 1, 1000, or 1,000,000 rows easily in Excel.

- String together a series of Wrangles as an automated sequence using Recipes.

- Much more...
