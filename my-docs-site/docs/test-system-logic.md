# Core Processing Logic

This page documents the critical `process_data` function used in our backend.

## How it works

The system takes a list of numbers and applies the following transformation:
1. It filters out any negative numbers.
2. It multiplies the remaining numbers by **10**.
3. It returns the sum of these new numbers.

### Example

Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
Output: `60` (because 1*10 + 2*10 + 3*10 = 60)
