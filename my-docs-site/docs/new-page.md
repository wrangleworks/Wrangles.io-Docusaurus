## Step 7: DIY Standardize Wrangle

Let's say that we would like to change the country name to the 3 letter abbreviation. To create a new Standardize Wrangle, go to **My Wrangles** in the tool menu.

On the Wrangles Task Pane, you will see many buttons for creating, editing, running, sharing and deleting Wrangles. We need to create a Standardize Wrangle, so click on **Standardize** followed by the **+** button.

This will create a new sheet named **Train-Standardize** along with a new window on the side. The sheet will have the following columns: **Find**, **Replace**, and **Notes**.

In our case, we will type all of the following:

![3_country_name_wrangle_standardize.png](/in-depth-examples/3_country_name_wrangle_standardize.png)

Once you are done adding data, click the submit button. After the Wrangle is finished training you can run it and get the results (shown below).
