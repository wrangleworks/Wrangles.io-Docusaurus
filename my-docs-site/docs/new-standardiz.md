The standardize Wrangle can be used to replace words or patterns with their "standardized" form. Currently we do not have a general use for Standardize Wrangles, so all are custom Wrangles ([DIY](https://wrangles.io/en/excel/my_wrangles) and [Bespoke](https://wrangles.io/en/waas/bespoke)) which are not included with the stock package. This is not to say that Standardize Wrangles are not as useful as the others, but that they are much more unique to each use case.

# Words

Keywords can be identified and replaced in batch.

Replace abbreviations, change alternative phrasing to be consistent or remove unwanted information.


- Single or multiple words can be matched.

- Matches are not case sensitive.

- Matches will be made against whole words only, partial matches within words will not be affected.

# Regular Expressions

# Multiple Variants
Standardizing data when variants exists can be done in two ways:
### Multiple Rows
Write each variant on a separate row

### Same Row
Write each variation on the same row, separated by a bar (|)
