The My Wrangles page of the Data Wrangles add-in is where Data Wranglers spend most of their time. It is where all of their DIY and Bespoke Wrangles can be found.

DIY Wrangles are custom Wrangles that you can build and train yourself. They can be Classify, Extract or Standardize Wrangles and are a very powerful tool which is easily implemented. 

# DIY Wrangles in Excel
The Data Wrangles Excel add-in makes it very easy to create your own Wrangle. Simply open the Data Wrangles tool bar and click on the "My Wrangles" button, this will open the Wrangles Task Pane. From here, click the button which pertains to the type of Wrangle (Classify, Extract or Standardize) you wish to create then click the **+** sign at the top right corner of the Task Pane. This will create a new sheet where the training data will need to be placed. Once the training data is all filled in and the model has been named, click the submit button to train your custom DIY Wrangle. Your DIY Wrangle is now ready for use from the Wrangles Task Pane.

Do not be worried if you have made an error and wish to change your training data, DIY Wrangles can always be retrained by clicking the update button in the Wrangles Task Pane.

See [Wrangles In Depth Example (Excel)](/excel/in-depth-examples) for another look at how to build a DIY Wrangle.

## Sharing Your DIY Wrangle
Just as with other Wrangles, DIY Wrangles can be shared with others. All you need to do is share the code shown from the share button on the Wrangles Task Pane.

The user receiving the code will then need to create a new Wrangle (being sure it is of the same type) and paste the code into the name box of the new Wrangle then click Submit. The Wrangle will now appear in the Data Wrangles task panel and will be ready for use once you see the green check mark. In the gif below, the "test recipe" Wrangle has been added.

## Organizing Wrangles

Tags and descriptions can be added to each wrangle by clicking on the wrangle. Tags are searchable and appear below the name of the wrangle. Descriptions are not searchable and will appear in a pop-up if you hover your cursor over the wrangle. The gif below shows how to add tags and descriptions:
