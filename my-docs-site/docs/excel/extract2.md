Wrangles in the Extract category pull specific information out of an input column and, in some instances, standardize the values.

If the extract wrangle finds multiple values, it returns them as a comma-separated list.

# Address \{#address\}

Addresses are an example of data that often gets lumped together into a single field.  
Most target systems require address parts (street, city, state, etc.) to be mapped  
to separate columns when importing. The **Address** extractor can wrangle that for you!


## Example \{#address-example\}

# Attributes \{#attributes\}

Extract numeric attributes such as lengths, weights, current, pressure and much more.

Attributes can be output as a Span (10-12" for example), Standard (a single value, averaged if a span is input), or an Object (key: value pairs of the span, standard, symbol, unit and value).

Desired units can be chosen for any given attribute (as long as there is more than one unit of measure for that attribute), and significant figures can be chosen as well.
