Wrangles can be shared with other users. By default, only you can access a Wrangle that you create.

To manage access to your Wrangle, click on additional options and then open the permissions panel.

## Share

To share with another user, click the add user button and then enter their email. The other user must have created a WrangleWorks account. Added users will default to the *User* role and the Wrangle will be added to their list of Wrangles.

## Available Roles

| :-- | :-- |
| User | Can run the wrangle. |
| Editor | Can also view and update the wrangle's contents. |
