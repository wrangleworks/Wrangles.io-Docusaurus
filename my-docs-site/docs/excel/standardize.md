This is a testing env
The Standardize Wrangle can be used to replace words or patterns with their "standardized" form. You can think of this Wrangle as a smart find-and-replace feature. In addition to our Standardize Stock Wrangles, you can customize Standardize Wrangles so that they are much more unique to your use case.

### Example

&lt;div style="overflow-x: auto">
&lt;table>
&lt;tr>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;/tr> Decimal Places = 2
&lt;tr>&lt;td>

| Before |
| --- |

# Fraction to Decimal
Standardize each fraction into its decimal equivalent.

## Tabset \{.tabset\}
### Example

&lt;div style="overflow-x: auto">
&lt;table>
&lt;tr>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;/tr> Decimal Places = 2
&lt;tr>&lt;td>

| .33 |
| .25 |
  
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>

# Phone Numbers
Standardize phone numbers to a consistent format by choosing from predefined format options or customizing your own. 
**Note:** This Wrangle reformats phone numbers starting from the last digit and cuts off any excess digits outside the specified format. It performs the reformatting from right to left.

## Tabset \{.tabset\}
### Options
| Option | Example |
| :---------------- | :---- |
| (XXX) XXX XXXX | (123) 456 7890 |
| (XXX)-XXX-XXXX | (123)-456-7890 |
| XXX XXX XXXX | 123 456 7890 |
| Custom format example: XXX-XXX | 567-890  |
  
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>


# Remove Attributes

&lt;table>
&lt;tr>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;th>&lt;/th>&lt;/tr> Character to Remove: !
&lt;tr>&lt;td>

| Before |

# Remove Words
Standardize your data by removing specific words. The Remove Words wrangle will remove words **found in** subsequent columns **from** the leftmost column. This can be done in entirety (where ordering of the words matters) with the "Tokenize to remove" parameter set to False, or word for word with "Tokenize to remove" set to True. The "Ignore Case" parameter can also be used to account for or ignore case when set to True or False (respectively).
